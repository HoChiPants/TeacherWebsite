Intersting things that came from the Authentication and Authorization were the following:
	I really liked how websites were easily blocked by the .Net framework that we used. It was impressive
	to see and im sure ill find more of it while searching the web now.
	I liked how easy it was to link and check to see if a user was authorized or not.
	I thought it was interesting to see how the email confirmation was used. I didnt know
	how to make it so you returned back to the original page after sending a confrimation email
	but it was still really impressive to see professor Germain do it. I also liked how you 
	can use a third party emailing service to send someone an email from anywhere. It was really intersting
	with the authorization that it was a lot like databasing, how you needed to query the database in order to 
	see what users were allowed. Some of the changes of implementation i did was that i created two different
	pages for viewing the course, one for the teacher and one for the chair. I did this so that the chair
	had buttons to change the classes and things like that. I did this instead of making if statements to
	help plan a little more for the future. I have noticed in this class there are times when we dont use
	old code and other times when we build off. Its easier to implement an if statement in the moment than 
	creating a whole webpage. I didnt really like how much pre existing database knowledge we were expected
	to have. In previous classes we just scratched the surface, not even doing much of a database searching
	but in this assignment we were expected to know much of it.

	Some of the things that I went above and beyond was creating a separate webpage for the updating of the courses
	I also made the webpages look similar to Professor Germain but added some color to spice it up. I also added in
	a facebook authenticator for the website as well. This allows the user to sign in for facebook for their login
	making it very easy to remember your username and password. This was a great feature that I added. I followed these
	on https://app.sendgrid.com/ , https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=windows ,
	https://developers.facebook.com/apps/ , https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/facebook-logins?view=aspnetcore-3.0

	Some improvements that I made from the previous assignment were making my code use more bootstrap to help it look better. 
	As well as sliming down unwanted code, naming my variables better, Formatting my code better and overall the look of everything
	has improved.
