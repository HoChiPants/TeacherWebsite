Comments to Evaluators:

Repository Link - Currently not necessary

UI/UX choices - Some of the choices I made for this interface were the following
Navbar
    Icon - to make sure you know that it is you who is logged on
    Courses - Enables the user from switching between courses that are being looked at
    Websites - Enables the user to switch between different pages this website has to
    offer.
    Role/User - Remind the user of their permissions and to make sure they are signed
    in as the right person.
    Sign out - a necessary button for all things that you can sign in
    U of U logo - Gotta rep the U, GO UTES!
    This was all done using bootstrap as well as the big red box at the top with
    information in it. That is because
    it flows more and is much easier to change.

Body
    Home - This was designed to give the information needed in an easy and simple way.
    This website would be used by people wanting to know more about the U as well as
    faculty or students needing to access their own information. The design was to give
    a little representation of the school with the colors as well as giving it a great
    title. The left contains information about the history and links to helpful sites.
    The right has photos of the websites that are also links for the faculty to use.
    The sides were made using bootstrap columns so they stay separate. One of the few
    things on this website that isn't bootstrap are the links. I think they look great
    just as bullet points.

    Overview.html - This starts out with the user profile giving the option of account
    settings which would allow the user to change their username, password, picture,
    etc. In the body of the webpage, you get all the informationof the teachers that
    you are assigned as well as the progress of their profiles. If more detailed
    information is requested, the user can then click on the teacher's profile and see
    their webpage. This gives the information in the same way the teacher prepares it,
    Learning Outcomes -> Evaluation Metric -> Students and their information.
    The progress bars were made using bootstrap but the collapsable object
    (even though it doesn't do its purpose) stayed as normal HTML. This is because it
    made more sense to leave it as something that changes yet gives you all the information
    needed.

    Course.html - This starts out with the user profile giving the option of account
    settings which would allow the user to change their username, password, picture,
    etc. The body of the webpage then gives you the option of adding or removing learning
    outcomes. These were bootstrapped because normally deleting an object is darker and
    creating an object is lighter. Then the rest of the page is a table that changes
    color when your mouse is over it. This is done to keep track of the learning outcome
    you are in. Both the table and the highlighting was used using bootstrap and this is
    because it looks better and has better functionality than normal. Inside each of the
    learning outcomes, you can see the assignments, exams and examples of great, good,
    and bad students submissions.There is also an option for a checkbox if the student
    has submitted so the teacher can easily mark it off.


Footer
    The capability to easily switch between roles. Used bootstrap to seprate them into
    columns.
